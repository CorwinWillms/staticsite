            <h1>Graduate and Doctoral Education</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Many Kinesiology undergraduates will go on to do further education. Some students will choose to obtain a graduate or doctoral degree in Kinesiology in order to pursue research, teaching or advanced roles in industry. Students looking to get into healthcare may apply to PA, PT or medical schools. These schools are highly competetive and may have requirements that lay ouside the realm of academics such as clinical hours. </p>
                <p>JMU has a number of programs of study for students pursuing higher education to become a liscensed medical professional. Some of the most common of these programs amoung KIN majors are Pre-Medicine, Pre-Physician Assistant, Pre-Physical Therapy, and Pre-Occupational Therapy. These programs act as minors for academic purposes and are specifically designed to prepare students for higher education in these fields. The full list of Pre-Professional Health Minors can be found <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/pph/pph-minors.shtml">here</a>.</p>
