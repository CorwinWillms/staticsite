        <h1>Welcome to my report page Dr. Stewart.</h1>
        
        <h3>Here are my justifications for the static site criteria as they are listed on the assignment page.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This site is meant to provide Kinesiology majors at JMU with resources that will help them succeed. I asked my friend what resources he uses often and tried to incorporate them into the site.
            </li>
            <li>
                None of the content I used was taken directly from other sources. All the code was written by me and the content was written by me according to what I found in my research and by asking KIN majors questions.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site contains five pages and any page can be reached through navigation links at the top of each page.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a header that is uniform on each of my site's pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every page on my site has navigation links to all the other pages through the header.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site supports different layouts for small screens. Every pages content shifts to a vertical orientation for small
            </li>
            <li>
                The style across my pages is more or less the same. Shared style is found in the "shared.css" file and all pages have their own style sheets for style that differs from the other pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                All but one of my pages contains images. All of my images have accurate alt attributes to my knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every page has an image of a beaker for the favicon.
            </li>
            <li>
                All of my images are in an "images" folder. All of my css is in a "CSS" folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site does not use any forbidden libraries.
            </li>
            <li>
                I noticed after the assignment was due that the language and character encodings are not declared in my html files.
            </li>
            <li>
                I believe my content is neatly aligned. 
            </li>
            <li>
                I believe my content has good spacing and I am not aware of any possible overlapping.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site uses two different font faces.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site includes a simple form on the home page.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site includes external links to study resources and tools.
            </li>
            <li>
                I believe my source code is readable and I have favored kebab-case.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site has a CSS animation for the header on every page.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site is stored in a github repository that has been shared with you.

            <li>
                My file names are all in lowercase and conventional characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                My site can be reached through https or http. Http requests are redirected to https.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                I commited to my repository during and after every work session. 
            </li>
